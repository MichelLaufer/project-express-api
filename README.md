# Express API Project

This week's project at the Technigo boot camp was to practice backend and Node.js by 
creating an API using Express. The task was to create an API with at least a couple of
RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item. 

Tech:
<br>Node.js, Express</br>

I used a JSON-file with an array of book objects to create a books-API.
I created endpoints on for example a list of all the books, for searching for 
single book items (using id), for the top rated books, for the books with the
largest number of pages and for language code. I also tried to use slice to divide
the books array into two lists.
